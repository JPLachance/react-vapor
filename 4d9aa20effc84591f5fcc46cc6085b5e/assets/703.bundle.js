Jumping to those marks is possible by clicking on them or on their labels.\n\n---\n\n## Related Components\n\n[Toggle](#/components/FlatSelect)\n\n[Radio Button](#/components/Radio)\n\n[Dropdown List](#/components/DropdownSearch)\n\n[Slide Toggle](#/styles/form-controls/slide-toggle)\n\n[Checkbox](#/components/Checkbox)\n"}}]);
