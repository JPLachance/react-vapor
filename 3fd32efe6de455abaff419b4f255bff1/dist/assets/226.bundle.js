A parent checkbox being in the partially selected state indicates that only some of its sub-options are selected, not all of them. Toggling the parent checkbox toggles all its sub-options.\n\n### Behavior\n\n-   As much as possible, preselect the recommended option. If there is none, preselect the option most likely to be selected by users.\n\n---\n\n## Related Components\n\n[Radio buttons](#/components/Radio)\n\n[Dropdown](#/components/DropdownSearch)\n\n[Toggle](#/components/FlatSelect)\n"}}]);
