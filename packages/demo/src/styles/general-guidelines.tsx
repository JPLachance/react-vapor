                        Error messages are used to inform the user that an error happened. They are the most likely to

                        addressed. There are two types of error messages: errors caused by the user, and errors caused
                        by the system. If you can’t avoid error messages, use them sparingly.

                                resolved. The banner appears at the top of the form and moves the content below.

                                screen by using a prompt. The user should be able to copy and paste the information.

                        confirm that their answers are valid. Inline Validation helps people complete forms quickly and
                        with less effort, fewer errors, and more satisfaction. The opposite approche is to validate all
                        the inputs at the end of the process, when the user submits the form.

                        appropriate for inline validation).
