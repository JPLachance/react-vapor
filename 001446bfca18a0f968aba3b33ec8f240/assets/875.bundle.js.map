Try to include no more than one action button besides the one to dismiss the Toast.\\n\\n### Behavior\\n\\n-   Only one Toast should be displayed at a time. If two consecutive Toasts have to be shown, the first one should be removed before the second one is shown.\\n\\n-   Toasts should not prevent users from interacting with page content. If preventing users from interacting with page content is unavoidable, consider using a [Prompt](#/components/ModalPrompt) instead.\\n\\n## Variations\\n\\nThe Toast type choice depends on the status of the operation to which the toast refers.\\n\\n| Type    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Success | Used to confirm that an operation was successfully executed. If the Toast contains a link or action, it has to me manually dismissed by the user. If not, it is self-dismissible.                                                               |\\n| Warning | Used to notify users that the operation they have launched may not yet be completed, or may not have had the expected result. If the Toast contains a link or action, it has to me manually dismissed by the user. If not, it is self-dismissible. |\\n| Error   | Used to notify users about an operation that was not successful. Users must interact with the Toast to dismiss it (i.e., it is not self-dismissible) to ensure they do not miss critical information.                                                           |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Related Components\\n\\n[Prompt](#/components/ModalPrompt)\\n\\n[Info Box](#/components/InfoBox)\\n\\n[Popover](#/components/Popover)\\n\\n[Tooltip](#/components/Tooltip)\\n\""],"sourceRoot":""}
